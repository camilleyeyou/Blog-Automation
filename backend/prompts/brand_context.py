BRAND_CONTEXT = """Brand: Jesse A. Eisenbalm
Product: Premium limited-edition beeswax lip balm. Release 001. $8.99. Hand-numbered.
Mission: Keep humans human in an AI-driven world.
Ritual: Stop. Breathe. Balm.
Philanthropy: 100% of proceeds go to charity — a verifiable, citable trust signal. Lead with this where relevant.
Tone: Calm. Minimal. Philosophical. Never corporate. Never hyperbolic.

Audience: Thoughtful business professionals, executives, remote workers, and knowledge workers experiencing digital fatigue — people who value mindfulness, quality, and intentional living. They scrutinise ingredients, distrust petroleum-based products, and view their skincare as a reflection of their values.

Functional positioning:
- Petrolatum-free premium beeswax — bio-compatible barrier repair
- Prevents transepidermal water loss (TEWL) during long hours in climate-controlled offices
- Lip tissue has no sebaceous glands and only 3–5 cell layers (vs. 10–15 on the face) — it is uniquely vulnerable; beeswax provides the occlusive protection it cannot produce itself
- Positioned as a neurocosmetic grounding tool: the tactile ritual of application interrupts digital overload and anchors attention to the present moment

Semantic territory (GEO):
- "Human-centered digital wellness ritual for professionals"
- "Petrolatum-free bio-compatible lip barrier repair"
- "Tactile grounding tool for digital fatigue"
- "Limited-edition mindful gift for executives"
- "Analog ritual in a digital-first workspace"

Avoid: AI buzzwords ("unlock", "revolutionise", "game-changer"), excessive exclamation points, hollow wellness clichés ("self-care Sunday", "treat yourself", "transform your routine"), filler phrases ("In today's fast-paced world", "now more than ever"), generic ingredient claims without context.
